# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview:

This web application is a rendition of tic-tac-toe utilizing colored blocks to represent player spaces. It was built to complete a milestone project for General Assembly's SEI program, demonstrating the reinforcement of my studies of web development.

## Big Goals

- **Build a web application from scratch**, without a starter codebase
- Use your programming skills to **work out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe**
- **Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files** in your application
- Build an application **to a specification that someone else gives you**
- **Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete** from the same computer
- **Craft a `README.md` file that explains your app** to the world
