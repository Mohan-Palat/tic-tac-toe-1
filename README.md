# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview:

This web application is a rendition of tic-tac-toe utilizing colored blocks to represent player spaces. It was built to complete a milestone project for General Assembly's SEI program, demonstrating the reinforcement of my studies of web development.

My goal for the project was to be as intuitive as possible with gane feedback, relying on minimal language and opting instead for visual cues and sound effects to determine things such as game winner, whose turn it is, and game options. Careful consideration was placed in many of these design decisions, such as disabling the hover effect when one player was victorious, signaling that no further moves would be possible in the current game. 

## Features:
- **Data Persistence:**  Upon closing the game or refreshing the page, it will resume in the exact position you left off.
- **Game Options:** Wipe the board at any point to restart a match, or reset the scores back to zero!
- **Full Audio Support:** All actions and events have feedback provided by audio cues, including distinct move and victory sounds for both players.
- **Responsive Scoreboard:** A scoreboard keeps track of successive victories, with visual cues for player victories and turn posession.
- **Mobile Support:** Fully supported on mobile with optimized styling for touch screen play
